# BoleroWebworkerDemo
Just a small demo project, showing how to use a (single) Webworker for long-running client-side background computations on a Bolero page.
(Workaround until we have Blazor multi-threading.)

Thanks to the [Bolero team](https://github.com/fsbolero/Bolero) and to [LostBeard](https://github.com/LostBeard/SpawnDev.BlazorJS).

Feedback is welcome.
